Welcome

no textbook (but there are some links to free ones on moodle site)
examples (guides, videos)
exercises (training)
practice exams (unlimited tries, untimed)
exams (3 tries, timed (but like 3 hours, will increase limit on request), must complete whole test for feedback, same as practice exams)

3 projects

33% hw: guides and training (collaboration okay)
33% exams: practice and official (no collaboration on official exams)
33% projects (each person writes own... because job applications require sole authorship)

discussion forum (can post vids)
screen capture... 

FIREFOX or Safari for MathML (maybe extensions?)

spreadsheets (Libreoffice, google sheets, excel... but sometimes small differences)
first "killer app": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#VisiCalc
tabulated data, 1800 BCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322
problems have csv download links, probably easiest if you install local software
it is hard to show work with spreadsheets (ctrl + ~), kinda need videos
hardest in the beginning (references, relative/absolute/partial)
also, making a histogram is very challenging for some reason

rstudio cloud / rstudio / r   (word calculator)
the hardest parts will be the beginning... getting data into a variable, c(), assignment, working directory, scripts/console
but later problems will be very easy with R!
easy to read solution; no need to really watch videos...
make one project for the whole class
rmarkdown for projects

try out both...

discrete vs continuous (computers let us use "continuous data")
binary

R
rgeom(10,0.4)
rnorm(10)
runif(10)>0.2

spreadsheet
=rand()
=if(rand()>0.2,1,0)
=floor(rand()*10+20)
=floor(rand()*10+20)/2

start on the exercises
