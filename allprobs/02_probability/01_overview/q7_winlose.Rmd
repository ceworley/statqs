Question
========
Cindy has two games today. Each game she will either win or lose. She has a `r p1` chance of winning the first game and a `r p2` chance of winning the second game.

Answerlist
--------
* What is the chance Cindy wins both games?
* What is the chance Cindy loses both games?
* What is the chance Cindy wins once and loses once (in either order)?


Solution

$$P(WW) = `r p1` \times `r p2` = `r p1*p2` $$
$$P(LL) = `r (1-p1)` \times `r (1-p2)` = `r (1-p1)*(1-p2)` $$
$$P(WL) = `r p1`\times `r 1-p2` = `r p1*(1-p2)` $$
$$P(LW) = `r (1-p1)`\times `r p2` = `r (1-p1)*p2`$$

Answerlist
--------
* Win,win: `r p1` * `r p2` =  **`r p1*p2`**
* Lose,lose: (1-`r p1`) * (1-`r p2`) =  **`r (1-p1)*(1-p2)`**
* WL or LW: 1-`r p1*p2`-`r (1-p1)*(1-p2)` = **`r 1-p1*p2-(1-p1)*(1-p2)`**
