<p>A scientist is investigating whether a chemical may effect the survival rate of an organism. Under the control conditions (no chemical), the organism has a survival rate of <span class="math inline">\(p_0=0.7143\)</span>. This value is known precisely because the organism has been grown under control conditions many many times.</p>
<p>The scientist has only grown the organism under experimental conditions (with chemical) <span class="math inline">\(n=98\)</span> times. In that sample, the survival rate is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.6327\)</span>.</p>
<p>The scientist wonders if this survival rate is significantly different from <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span>. To investigate this, the scientist will determine the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value represents the probability of getting a sample proportion as far (or farther) from <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span> due to chance alone. <span class="math display">\[p\text{-value} ~=~ P\left(\big|Z\big| &gt; \frac{\big|\hat{p}-p_0\big|}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \right) \]</span></p>
<p>It is common to compare the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value to 0.05.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(p\text{-value} &lt; 0.05\)</span> then “significant”</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(p\text{-value} \ge 0.05\)</span> then “not significant”</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<div id='Q' style='background: #AAAAFF'> Determine the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value. </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='Q' style='background: #AAAAFF'> The difference is significant. The chemical seems to alter the growth of the organism. / The difference is not significant. We don’t know whether the chemical alters the growth of the organism. </div>
</li>
</ol>
