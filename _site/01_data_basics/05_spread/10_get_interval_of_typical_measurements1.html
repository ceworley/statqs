<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Sometimes a population is well characterized. In this case we know its mean and standard deviation. We use greek letters <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (“mu”) and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> (“sigma”) when describing the population (instead of the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> (“xbar”) and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> used for sample mean and sample standard deviation). <span class="math display">\[\mu = \text{population mean} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[\sigma = \text{population standard deviation} \]</span></p>
<p>When measuring individuals from a population, we expect most measurements to be within the <em>interval of typical measurements</em>. We will define the interval of typical measurements (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals" target="blank">interval notation</a>): <span class="math display">\[\text{interval of typical measurements} = (\mu-2\sigma,\,\mu+2\sigma) \]</span> In other words, we expect most measurements to be between two bounds. <span class="math display">\[\text{lower bound of interval of typical measurements} = \mu-2\sigma \]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{upper bound of interval of typical measurements} = \mu+2\sigma \]</span></p>
<h3 id="actual-question">Actual Question</h3>
<p>A population of lizards has a mean length of <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 35.9\)</span> cm and a standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=5.0\)</span> cm. Determine the interval of typical measurements.</p>
