Question
========
Bob has a `r p1` chance of winning a game. If Bob wins, he has a `r p2` chance of being happy after the game. If Bob loses, he has a `r p3` chance of being happy after the game. 

After the game, you notice Bob is happy. What is the probability that Bob won his game? (Do not answer as a percentage; answer as a decimal.)


Solution
========

(ANS=`r pwgh`)

Use the definition of [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability){target="blank"}.
$$P(\text{win given happy}) = \frac{P(\text{win and happy})}{P(\text{happy})}$$
We can first determine all the joint probabilities.
$$P(A\text{ and }B) = P(A)\cdot P(B\text{ given } A) $$
$$\begin{aligned}
P(\text{win and happy}) &= `r p1`\times`r p2` = `r p1*p2`\\
P(\text{win and sad}) &= `r p1`\times(1-`r p2`) = `r p1*(1-p2)`\\
P(\text{lose and happy}) &= (1-`r p1`)\times`r p3` = `r (1-p1)*p3`\\
P(\text{lose and sad}) &= (1-`r p1`)\times(1-`r p3`) = `r (1-p1)*(1-p3)`\\
\end{aligned}$$

Notice there are two disjoint ways Bob could be happy.
$$\begin{aligned}
P(\text{happy}) &= P\left(\text{[win and happy] OR [lose and happy]}\right) \\
&= P(\text{win and happy}) + P(\text{lose and happy}) \\
&= `r pwh`+`r plh` \\
&= `r ph`
\end{aligned}$$
So, back to the conditional probability.
$$P(\text{win given happy}) = \frac{`r pwh`}{`r ph`} = `r signif(pwgh,3)`$$
