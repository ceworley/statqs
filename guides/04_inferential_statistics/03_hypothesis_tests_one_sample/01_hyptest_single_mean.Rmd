Question
========

A scientist is investigating whether a chemical may effect the growth of an organism. Under the control conditions (no chemical), the organism grows to a mean mass of $\mu_0 = `r mu0`$ grams with a standard deviation of $\sigma_0 =`r sig0`$ grams. These values are known precisely because the organism has been grown under control conditions many many times.

The scientist has only grown the organism under experimental conditions (with chemical) $n=`r n`$ times. In that sample, the masses have a mean $\bar{x}=`r xbar`$.

The scientist wonders if this sample mean is significantly different from $\mu_0$. To investigate this, the scientist will determine the [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value){target="blank"}. The $p$-value represents the probability of getting a sample mean as far (or farther) from $\mu_0$ due to chance alone.
$$p\text{-value} ~=~ P\left(\big|Z\big| > \frac{\big|\bar{x}-\mu_0\big|}{\sigma_0/\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

It is common to compare the $p$-value to 0.05.

* If $p\text{-value} < 0.05$ then "significant"
* If $p\text{-value} \ge 0.05$ then "not significant"

a. ##ANSWER1##
b. Is the difference significant? ##ANSWER2##


Answerlist
--------
* Determine the $p$-value.
* The difference is significant; the chemical seems to alter the growth of the organism.
* The difference is not significant; we don't know whether the chemical alters the growth of the organism.


Solution
========

[video](https://vimeo.com/531952635){target="_blank"}

We need to calculate the $p$-value.
$$\begin{aligned}
p\text{-value} &= P\left(\big|Z\big| > \frac{\big|\bar{x}-\mu_0\big|}{\sigma_0/\sqrt{n}} \right) \\\\
&= P\left(\big|Z\big| > \frac{\big|`r xbar`-`r mu0`\big|}{`r sig0`/\sqrt{`r n`}} \right) \\\\
&= P\left(\big|Z\big| > `r abs(xbar-mu0)/sig0*sqrt(n)` \right) \\\\
&= `r pval`
\end{aligned}$$

Of course you could have rounded the $z$ score. Either of the following will also get credit.

$$p\text{-value} ~=~ \left(\big|Z\big| > `r zlo` \right) ~=~ `r pvallo`$$
$$p\text{-value} ~=~ \left(\big|Z\big| > `r zhi` \right) ~=~ `r pvalhi`$$

`r myst`

Answerlist
--------
* `r pval`
* `r pval<0.05`
* `r pval>=0.05`
