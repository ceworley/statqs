Question
========

A farm produces 4 types of fruit: `r fs[1]`, `r fs[2]`, `r fs[3]`, and `r fs[4]`. The fruits' masses have population parameters dependent on the type of fruit. (All values are in grams.)

```{r tab1, results="asis",echo=F}
knitr::kable(tab1,format="html",table.attr='class="bordered-table"', align = "cccc",row.names=F)
```


A sample of each type is weighed. The results are shown below.

```{r tab2, results="asis",echo=F}
knitr::kable(tab2,format="html",table.attr='class="bordered-table"', align = "cccc",row.names=F)
```

The population parameters and sample statistics can be [downloaded as a csv](fruit.csv){target="blank"}.

For each sample, determine the mean's standard score and the mean's [cumulative probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function){target="blank"} by assuming the requirements for the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem){target="blank"} are met. Then determine which sample mean is most unusually large, most unusually small, most typically sized, and most unusually sized.

The standard score of a sample mean:
$$z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$$
Some people prefer to call this denominator [the standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error){target="blank"}.
$$\text{standard error of mean} = \text{SEM} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
So the standard score ($z$-score) of a sample mean can also be expressed as
$$z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\text{SEM}} $$

Solution

[video](https://vimeo.com/531938648){target="_blank"}

The formula to determine the $z$-score of a **sample mean** is the ratio with numerator the difference between measurement and population mean and denominator the standard error of the mean.

$$z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} $$

The highest $z$-score (furthest right on [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line){target="blank"}) corresponds to the most unusually large sample mean. 

The smallest $z$-score (furthest left on [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line){target="blank"}) corresponds to the most unusually small sample mean.

The smallest [**absolute**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value){target="blank"} $z$-score corresponds to the most usually sized sample mean.

The largest [**absolute**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value){target="blank"} $z$-score corresponds to the most unusually sized sample mean.


### Spreadsheet:

By using the formulas, you should get a spreadsheet like the one displayed here:

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=5,echo=F}
draw_ss = function(df){
  nrow = length(df[,1])
  ncol = length(df[1,])
  par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))
  plot(0,0,type="n",xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1),axes=F,ann=F)
  hi = 1:((nrow+2)*2+1)
  vi = 1:((ncol+1)*2+1)
  hpos = seq(1,0,length.out=(nrow+2)*2+1)
  vpos = seq(0,1,length.out=(ncol+1)*2+1)
  hlin = hpos[hi%%2==1]
  ytex = hpos[hi%%2==0]
  vlin = vpos[vi%%2==1]
  xtex = vpos[vi%%2==0]
  abline(h=hlin)
  abline(h=hlin[2],lwd=3)
  abline(v=vlin)
  abline(v=vlin[2],lwd=3)
  for(i in 2:(ncol+1)){
    text(xtex[i],ytex[1],LETTERS[i-1],col=rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5))
    text(xtex[i],ytex[2],colnames(df)[i-1])
  }    
  for(i in 2:(nrow+2)){
    text(xtex[1],ytex[i],i-1,col=rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5))
  }
  for(i in 1:nrow){
    for(j in 1:ncol){
      text(xtex[j+1],ytex[i+2],df[i,j])
    }
  }
}

data2 = data.frame(f,mus,sigs,ns,xbars,signif(ses,4),zs,ps,abs(zs))
colnames(data2) = c("fruit",
                   "mu",
                   "sigma",
                   "n",
                   "xbar",
                   "SEM",
                   "z",
                   "P(Z<z)",
                   "abs(z)")

draw_ss(data2)
```
\

### To do this in R:

```{r}
data = read.csv("fruit.csv", as.is=TRUE)
fruit = data$fruit
mu = data$mu
sigma = data$sigma
n = data$n
xbar = data$xbar

SEM = sigma/sqrt(n)
z = round( (xbar-mu)/SEM ,2)
cum_prob = round( pnorm(z) ,4)
data.frame(data,SEM,z,cum_prob,abs(z))

# Most unusually large
fruit[z==max(z)]

# Most unusually small
fruit[z==min(z)]

# Most typically sized
fruit[abs(z)==min(abs(z))]

# Most unusually sized
fruit[abs(z)==max(abs(z))]
```

* We use the formula for calculating the `r f[1]` sample-mean $z$ score.
$$z = \frac{`r xbars[1]`-`r mus[1]`}{`r sigs[1]`/\sqrt{`r ns[1]`}} = `r zs[1]` $$
* Use the $z$ table to find the cumulative probability.
$$P(Z<`r zs[1]`) = `r ps[1]` $$
* We use the formula for calculating the `r f[2]` sample-mean $z$ score.
$$z = \frac{`r xbars[2]`-`r mus[2]`}{`r sigs[2]`/\sqrt{`r ns[2]`}} = `r zs[2]` $$
* Use the $z$ table to find the cumulative probability.
$$P(Z<`r zs[2]`) = `r ps[2]` $$
