Question
========

In some game, each trial has a $p = `r p`$ probability of success. A player will attempt `r n` trials. What is the probability that the number of successes is more than `r xt`?

(Even though single trials are **not** normally distributed [they follow a [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution){target="_blank"}], the random totals will be normally distributed.
See [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem){target="_blank"}.
Also, I have already made the [continuity correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction){target="_blank"} by setting the boundary to a [half-integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer){target="_blank"}. )

Solution
========

We determine the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution.
$$\mu ~=~ np ~=~ (`r n`)(`r p`) ~=~ `r mut`$$
$$\sigma ~=~ \sqrt{np(1-p)} ~=~ \sqrt{(`r n`)(`r p`)(`r 1-p`)} ~=~ `r sigt` $$

We determine a $z$-score. (In the de Moivre-Laplace notes, I used $\sum x$ to emphasize that a binomial variable is a sum of Bernoulli trials. Here, I will just use $x$ as the boundary for number of successes, because this is the more common notation.)
$$\begin{aligned}
z &= \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \\\\
&= \frac{`r xt`-`r mut`}{`r sigt`} \\\\
&= `r z`
\end{aligned}$$

Then, find the standard normal probability.

$$P(Z > `r z`) ~=~ `r ra` $$

Of course, you could have rounded $z$, so the following will also get credit.
$$P(Z > `r zlo`) ~=~ `r ralo` $$
$$P(Z > `r zhi`) ~=~ `r rahi` $$
