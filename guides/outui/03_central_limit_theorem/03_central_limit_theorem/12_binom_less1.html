<p>In some game, each trial has a <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.69\)</span> probability of success. A player will attempt 147 trials. What is the probability that the number of successes is less than 106.5?</p>
<p>(Even though single trials are <strong>not</strong> normally distributed [they follow a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution" target="_blank">Bernoulli distribution</a>], the random totals will be normally distributed. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" target="_blank">central limit theorem</a>. Also, I have already made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction" target="_blank">continuity correction</a> by setting the boundary to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer" target="_blank">half-integer</a>. )</p>
