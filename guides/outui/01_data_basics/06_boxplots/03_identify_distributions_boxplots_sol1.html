<ul>
<li>The bell shape has many measurements near the median and some measurements far, so its box is small but whiskers long.</li>
<li>The uniform shape has 4 approximately equal regions (left whisker, left side of box, right side of box, and right whisker).</li>
<li>The bimodal distribution has few measurements near the median and many far from it, so its box is large and whiskers small.</li>
<li>The right-skew distribution has a few measurements much higher than the median, so its right whisker is long.</li>
<li>The left-skew distribution has a few measurements much lower than the median, so its left whisker is long.</li>
</ul>
