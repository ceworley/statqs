<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" target="blank">standard score</a> (<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>) can be calculated from a measurement (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>), the population mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>), and the population standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>). <span class="math display">\[z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \]</span> With a little algebra, you can create another formula solved for the measurement. <span class="math display">\[x = \mu+z\sigma\]</span></p>
<h3 id="actual-question">Actual question</h3>
<p>A gambler is interested in the sum of 40 rolls of 8-sided dice. The process of summing 40 rolls of 8-sided dice can be repeated infinitely many times, giving independent results each time, so those sums can be thought of as an infinitely large population. This population happens to be approximately normal (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" target="blank">central limit theorem</a>).</p>
<p>The gambler knows how to calculate the population mean (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution" target="blank">discrete-uniform distribution</a>). <span class="math display">\[\mu = 40\cdot\frac{1+8}{2} = 180 \]</span> She also knows how to calculate the population standard deviation. <span class="math display">\[\sigma = \sqrt{40} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{8^2-1}{12}} = 14.49 \]</span></p>
