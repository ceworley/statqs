<p>All three distributions look like they have similar ranges (widths), but different shapes. So, we will use the fact that for a given range, bell shape has the smallest standard deviation and bimodal has the largest standard deviation. This is because a bell shape has many measurements near the middle, whereas the bimodal shape has many measurements near the edges of its interval.</p>
