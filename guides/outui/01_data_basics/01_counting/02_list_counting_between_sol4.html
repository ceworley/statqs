<p>First, it helps to sort the data. <span class="math display">\[\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = 41, 42, 42, 43, 43, 46, 46, 47, 47, 47\]</span></p>
<h3 id="r">R</h3>
<p>You could use R to sort the data:</p>
<pre><code>sort(c(47,42,47,47,41,42,43,43,46,46))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 41 42 42 43 43 46 46 47 47 47</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/531555871" target="_blank">Video of a similar problem solved with R</a></p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use <code>Sort</code> function.</p>

<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=5) There are 5 measurements between 43.5 and 47.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[43.5&lt;\mathbf{x}&lt;47.5]=5\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=5) There are 5 measurements outside 43.5 and 48.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[\mathbf{x}&lt;43.5\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}&gt;48.5]=5\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=3) There are 3 measurements closer than 1 units from 47.5. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are between 46.5 and 48.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 1 from 47.5 and adding 1 to 47.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-47.5\big|&lt;1\right]=3\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=3) There are 3 measurements farther than 2.5 units from 45. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are outside 42.5 and 47.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 2.5 from 45 and adding 2.5 to 45. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-45\big|&gt;2.5\right]=3\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=0.5) You can guess and check until you find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer" target="blank">half-integer</a> that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.5\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-46\big|&lt;0.5\right] ~=~ 2\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 45.5 and 46.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 0.5 to/from 46. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-46\big|&lt;0.5\right] ~=~ 2\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=1.5) You can guess and check until you find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer" target="blank">half-integer</a> that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 1.5\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-43\big|&gt;1.5\right] ~=~ 6\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 41.5 and 44.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 1.5 to/from 43. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-43\big|&gt;1.5\right] ~=~ 6\]</span> </div>
</li>
