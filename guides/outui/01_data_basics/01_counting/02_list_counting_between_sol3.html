<p>First, it helps to sort the data. <span class="math display">\[\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = 31, 31, 31, 31, 32, 32, 37, 37, 38, 39\]</span></p>
<h3 id="r">R</h3>
<p>You could use R to sort the data:</p>
<pre><code>sort(c(37,37,32,31,31,31,32,39,31,38))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 31 31 31 31 32 32 37 37 38 39</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/531555871" target="_blank">Video of a similar problem solved with R</a></p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use <code>Sort</code> function.</p>

<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=1) There are 1 measurements between 38.5 and 39.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[38.5&lt;\mathbf{x}&lt;39.5]=1\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=10) There are 10 measurements outside 33.5 and 35.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[\mathbf{x}&lt;33.5\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}&gt;35.5]=10\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=2) There are 2 measurements closer than 2 units from 35.5. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are between 33.5 and 37.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 2 from 35.5 and adding 2 to 35.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-35.5\big|&lt;2\right]=2\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=8) There are 8 measurements farther than 1 units from 36.5. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are outside 35.5 and 37.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 1 from 36.5 and adding 1 to 36.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-36.5\big|&gt;1\right]=8\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=0.5) You can guess and check until you find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer" target="blank">half-integer</a> that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.5\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-38\big|&lt;0.5\right] ~=~ 1\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 37.5 and 38.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 0.5 to/from 38. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-38\big|&lt;0.5\right] ~=~ 1\]</span> </div>
