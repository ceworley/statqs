<p>First, it helps to sort the data. <span class="math display">\[\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = 52, 53, 53, 53, 55, 55, 56, 56, 58, 59\]</span></p>
<h3 id="r">R</h3>
<p>You could use R to sort the data:</p>
<pre><code>sort(c(56,58,53,53,55,52,55,53,59,56))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 52 53 53 53 55 55 56 56 58 59</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/531555871" target="_blank">Video of a similar problem solved with R</a></p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use <code>Sort</code> function.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=9) There are 9 measurements between 50.5 and 58.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[50.5&lt;\mathbf{x}&lt;58.5]=9\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=8) There are 8 measurements outside 54.5 and 55.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[\mathbf{x}&lt;54.5\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}&gt;55.5]=8\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=10) There are 10 measurements closer than 4 units from 55.5. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are between 51.5 and 59.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 4 from 55.5 and adding 4 to 55.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-55.5\big|&lt;4\right]=10\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=1) There are 1 measurements farther than 3.5 units from 56. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are outside 52.5 and 59.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 3.5 from 56 and adding 3.5 to 56. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-56\big|&gt;3.5\right]=1\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=1.5) You can guess and check until you find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer" target="blank">half-integer</a> that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 1.5\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-54\big|&lt;1.5\right] ~=~ 5\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 52.5 and 55.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 1.5 to/from 54. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-54\big|&lt;1.5\right] ~=~ 5\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=2) You can guess and check until you find an integer that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 2\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-56.5\big|&gt;2\right] ~=~ 5\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 54.5 and 58.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 2 to/from 56.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-56.5\big|&gt;2\right] ~=~ 5\]</span> </div>
</li>
