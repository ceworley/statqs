Question
========

Match the five [boxplots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot){target="blank"} with their appropriate description.

```{r echo=F,fig.width=8,fig.height=5}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(j in 1:5){
  par(mar=c(2,1,3,1))
  i = ord[j]
  boxplot(data[,i],main=paste0("boxplot ",j),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7),horizontal=T,axes=F)
  box("figure")
}
```

Answerlist
--------
* `r types[ord2[1]]` (Enter an integer between 1 and 5)
* `r types[ord2[2]]` (Enter an integer between 1 and 5)
* `r types[ord2[3]]` (Enter an integer between 1 and 5)
* `r types[ord2[4]]` (Enter an integer between 1 and 5)
* `r types[ord2[5]]` (Enter an integer between 1 and 5)



Solution
========

[video](https://vimeo.com/531913006){target="_blank"}

* The bell shape has many measurements near the median and some measurements far, so its box is small but whiskers long. 
* The uniform shape has 4 approximately equal regions (left whisker, left side of box, right side of box, and right whisker). 
* The bimodal distribution has few measurements near the median and many far from it, so its box is large and whiskers small.
* The right-skew distribution has a few measurements much higher than the median, so its right whisker is long.
* The left-skew distribution has a few measurements much lower than the median, so its left whisker is long.
