Question
========

When measuring individuals from a population, we expect most measurements to be within the *interval of typical measurements*. We will define the interval of typical measurements (using [interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals){target="blank"}):
$$\text{interval of typical measurements} = (\mu-2\sigma,\,\mu+2\sigma) $$
In other words, we expect we expect most measurements to be between two bounds.
$$\text{lower bound of interval of typical measurements} = \mu-2\sigma $$
$$\text{upper bound of interval of typical measurements} = \mu+2\sigma $$

### Actual Question

A population of lizards has a mean length of $\mu = `r sprintf("%.1f",mu)`$ cm and a standard deviation of $\sigma=`r sprintf("%.1f",sig)`$ cm. Determine the interval of typical measurements.

Answerlist
--------
* Determine the lower bound of the interval of typical measurements.
* Determine the upper bound of the interval of typical measurements.


Solution
========

You need to use the formulas. Remember your [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations){target="blank"}!

Answerlist
--------
* Use the formula. $\mu-2\sigma = `r mu` - 2(`r sig`) = `r mu-2*sig`$
* Use the formula. $\mu+2\sigma = `r mu` + 2(`r sig`) = `r mu+2*sig`$
