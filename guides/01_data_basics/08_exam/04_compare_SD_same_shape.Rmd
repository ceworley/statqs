Question
========

Three large samples were taken from three different populations. Their distributions are shown as histograms.

```{r echo=F,fig.width=6,fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(0,0,0,0))
par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist(x1,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=seq(0,100,2.5),ann=F,axes=F,ylim=c(0,ym),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7))
axis(1,line=0,at=seq(0,100,5))
mtext("sample X",2,0,srt=90)

par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist(x2,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=seq(0,100,2.5),ann=F,axes=F,ylim=c(0,ym),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7))
axis(1,line=0,at=seq(0,100,5))
mtext("sample Y",2,0,srt=90)

par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist(x3,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=seq(0,100,2.5),ann=F,axes=F,ylim=c(0,ym),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7))
axis(1,line=0,at=seq(0,100,5))
mtext("sample Z",2,0,srt=90)

Solution
========

All three distributions look like they have similar `r c("uniform", "bell", "bimodal")[type]` shape, but their centers and spreads are all different. 


a. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[mid==min(mid)]`)
b. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[mid==max(mid)]`)
c. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[width==min(width)]`)
d. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[width==max(width)]`)


Answerlist
--------
* The distribution with its center sitting furthest left has the smallest mean.
* .
* .
* The distribution with its center sitting furthest right has the largest mean.
* .
* .
* The least wide distribution has the smallest standard deviation. It is this simple because all distributions have the same shape.
