Question
========

Three large samples were taken from three different populations. Their distributions are shown as histograms.

```{r echo=F,fig.width=6,fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(0,0,0,0))
par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist(x1,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=seq(0,100,2.5),ann=F,axes=F,ylim=c(0,ym),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7))
axis(1,line=0,at=seq(0,100,5))
mtext("sample X",2,0,srt=90)

par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist(x2,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=seq(0,100,2.5),ann=F,axes=F,ylim=c(0,ym),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7))
axis(1,line=0,at=seq(0,100,5))
mtext("sample Y",2,0,srt=90)

par(mar=c(2,2,2,2))
hist(x3,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=seq(0,100,2.5),ann=F,axes=F,ylim=c(0,ym),col=rgb(0.9,0.7,0.7))
axis(1,line=0,at=seq(0,100,5))

Solution
========

All three distributions look like they have similar ranges (widths), but different shapes. So, we will use the fact that for a given range, bell shape has the smallest standard deviation and bimodal has the largest standard deviation. This is because a bell shape has many measurements near the middle, whereas the bimodal shape has many measurements near the edges of its interval. 


a. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[mid==min(mid)]`)
b. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[mid==max(mid)]`)
c. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[type==min(type)]`)
d. (`r c("X","Y","Z")[type==max(type)]`)

Answerlist
--------
* The distribution with its center sitting furthest left has the smallest mean.
* .
* .
* The distribution with its center sitting furthest right has the largest mean.
* .
* .
* The bell shape has the smallest standard deviation. It is this simple because all the distributions have the same range, but the bell has a higher fraction near its mean.
* .
* .
* The bimodal shape has the largest standard deviation. It is this simple because all the distributions have the same range, but the bimodal shape has a higher fraction far from its mean.
