Question
========

A random procedure generated the following sample (sequence of measurements):

$$\mathbf{x} = `r x` $$

```{r echo=F}
fn = paste0("list_counting_between_data.csv")
write.csv(data.frame(i,x), file = fn, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

You can download the data as a CSV file (for importing into a spreadsheet or R): 
[`r fn`](`r fn`)

Answerlist
--------
* How many of the measurements are inside `r b1[1]` to `r b1[2]`? In other words, determine $\#[\mathbf{x}>`r b1[1]`\texttt{ AND } \mathbf{x}<`r b1[2]`]$. In other words, determine $\#[`r b1[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b1[2]`]$.
* How many of the measurements are outside `r b2[1]` to `r b2[2]`? In other words, determine $\#[\mathbf{x}<`r b2[1]`\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}>`r b2[2]`]$. In other words, determine $\#[\texttt{NOT}(`r b2[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b2[2]`)]$.
* How many of the measurements are closer than `r d3` `r wrd3` from `r c3`? In other words, determine $\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c3`\big|<`r d3`\right]$.
* How many of the measurements are farther than `r d4` `r wrd4` from `r c4`? In other words, determine $\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c4`\big|>`r d4`\right]$.
* Determine `r wrdint5` radius $r$ of an interval with center `r c5` such that $\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c5`\big|<r\right] ~=~ `r nb5`$.
* Determine `r wrdint6` radius $r$ of an interval with center `r c6` such that $\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c6`\big|>r\right] ~=~ `r no6`$.


Solution
========

First, it helps to sort the data.
$$\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = `r sort(x)`$$

### R

You could use R to sort the data:

```{r echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
str1 = paste('sort(c(',paste(x,collapse=","),'))',collapse="")
str2 = gsub(" ", "", str1, fixed = TRUE)
cat(str2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sort(x)
```

### Spreadsheet

You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use ``Sort`` function.

Answerlist
--------
* (ANS=`r nb1`) There are `r nb1` measurements between `r b1[1]` and `r b1[2]`. $$\#[`r b1[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b1[2]`]=`r nb1`$$
* (ANS=`r no2`) There are `r no2` measurements outside `r b2[1]` and `r b2[2]`. $$\#[\mathbf{x}<`r b2[1]`\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}>`r b2[2]`]=`r no2`$$
* (ANS=`r nb3`) There are `r nb3` measurements closer than `r d3` units from `r c3`. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are between `r b3[1]` and `r b3[2]`. These boundaries are found by subtracting `r d3` from `r c3` and adding `r d3` to `r c3`. $$\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c3`\big|<`r d3`\right]=`r nb3`$$
* (ANS=`r no4`) There are `r no4` measurements farther than `r d4` units from `r c4`. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are outside `r b4[1]` and `r b4[2]`. These boundaries are found by subtracting `r d4` from `r c4` and adding `r d4` to `r c4`. $$\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c4`\big|>`r d4`\right]=`r no4`$$
* (ANS=`r d5`) You can guess and check until you find `r wrdint5` that satisfies the equation. It turns out that $r = `r d5`$ satisfies the equation, because $\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c5`\big|<`r d5`\right] ~=~ `r nb5`$. Notice the boundaries are `r b5[1]` and `r b5[2]`, which are found by adding/subtracting `r d5` to/from `r c5`. $$\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c5`\big|<`r d5`\right] ~=~ `r nb5`$$
* (ANS=`r d6`) You can guess and check until you find `r wrdint6` that satisfies the equation. It turns out that $r = `r d6`$ satisfies the equation, because $\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c6`\big|>`r d6`\right] ~=~ `r no6`$. Notice the boundaries are `r b6[1]` and `r b6[2]`, which are found by adding/subtracting `r d6` to/from `r c6`. $$\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c6`\big|>`r d6`\right] ~=~ `r no6`$$
