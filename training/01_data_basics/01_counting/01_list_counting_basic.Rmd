Question
========

A [random procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation){target="blank"} generated the following sample (sequence of measurements):

$$\mathbf{x} = `r x` $$

```{r echo=F}
fn = paste0("list_counting_basic_data.csv")
write.csv(data.frame(i,x), file = fn, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

You can download the data as a CSV file (for importing into a spreadsheet or R): 
[`r fn`](`r fn`)

Answerlist
--------
* How many of the measurements are less than `r x1`? In other words, determine $\#[\mathbf{x}<`r x1`]$.
* How many of the measurements are less than or equal to `r x2`? In other words, determine $\#[\mathbf{x}\le`r x2`]$.
* How many of the measurements are greater than `r x3`? In other words, determine $\#[\mathbf{x}>`r x3`]$.
* How many of the measurements are greater than or equal to `r x4`? In other words, determine $\#[\mathbf{x}\ge`r x4`]$.
* If `r i5` of the measurements are less than $x_{\text{c}}$, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\#[\mathbf{x}<x_{\text{c}}] = `r i5`$.
* If `r i6` of the measurements are less than or equal to $x_{\text{c}}$, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\#[\mathbf{x}\le x_{\text{c}}] = `r i6`$.
* If `r i7` of the measurements are greater than $x_{\text{c}}$, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\#[\mathbf{x}>x_{\text{c}}] = `r i7`$.
* If `r i8` of the measurements are greater than or equal to $x_{\text{c}}$, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\#[\mathbf{x}\ge x_{\text{c}}] = `r i8`$.


Solution
========



First, it helps to sort the data.
$$\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = `r sort(x)`$$

### Spreadsheet 

You could use a spreadsheet to sort the data. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use [``Sort`` function](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Calc_Guide/Sorting_data){target="blank"}.

### R

You could use R to sort the data:

```{r echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
str1 = paste('sort(c(',paste(x,collapse=","),'))',collapse="")
str2 = gsub(" ", "", str1, fixed = TRUE)
cat(str2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sort(x)
```

Answerlist
--------
* (ANS=`r i1`) There are `r i1` measurements less than `r x1`. $\#[\mathbf{x}<`r x1`]=`r i1`$ 
* (ANS=`r i2`) There are `r i2` measurements less than or equal to `r x2`. $\#[\mathbf{x}\le`r x2`]=`r i2`$
* (ANS=`r i3`) There are `r i3` measurements greater than `r x3`. $\#[\mathbf{x}>`r x3`]=`r i3`$
* (ANS=`r i4`) There are `r i4` measurements greater than or equal to `r x4`. $\#[\mathbf{x}\ge`r x4`]=`r i4`$
* (ANS=`r x5`) Measurement value `r x5` has `r i5` measurements less than it, so $x_{\text{c}}=`r x5`$. In other words, $\#[\mathbf{x}<`r x5`] = `r i5`$.
* (ANS=`r x6`) Measurement value `r x6` has `r i6` measurements less than or equal to it, so $x_{\text{c}}=`r x6`$. In other words, $\#[\mathbf{x}\le `r x6`] = `r i6`$.
* (ANS=`r x7`) Measurement value `r x7` has `r i7` measurements greater than it, so $x_{\text{c}}=`r x7`$. In other words, $\#[\mathbf{x}>`r x7`] = `r i7`$.
* (ANS=`r x8`) Measurement value `r x8` has `r i8` measurements greater than or equal to it, so $x_{\text{c}}=`r x8`$. In other words, $\#[\mathbf{x}\ge `r x8`] = `r i8`$.
