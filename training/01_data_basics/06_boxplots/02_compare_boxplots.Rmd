Question
========

Five different populations were sampled, and the measurements were visualized as five [boxplots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot){target="blank"}. (Note: typical boxplots indicate outliers with dots. For simplicity, these boxplots include all outliers in the whiskers.)

```{r echo=F,fig.width=8,fig.height=5}
bp = boxplot(boxes,horizontal=T,range=0,names=c("V","W","X","Y","Z"),at=5:1)
```

```{r echo=F}
AA = c("V","W","X","Y","Z")
```

A.  `r AA[strsplit(ans1,"")[[1]]=="1"]`. You find the sample with a whisker that goes furthest to the right.
B.  `r AA[strsplit(ans2,"")[[1]]=="1"]`. You find the sample with a whisker that goes furthest to the left.
C.  `r AA[strsplit(ans3,"")[[1]]=="1"]`. You find the sample with the median (thick line in middle of box) furthest to the right.
D.  `r AA[strsplit(ans4,"")[[1]]=="1"]`. You find the sample with the median (thick line in middle of box) furthest to the left.
E.  `r AA[strsplit(ans5,"")[[1]]=="1"]`. You find the sample with the widest box.
F.  `r AA[strsplit(ans6,"")[[1]]=="1"]`. You find the sample with the narrowest box.
