Question
========

A [random procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation){target="blank"} generated the following sample (sequence of measurements):

$$\mathbf{x} = `r x` $$

```{r echo=F}
fn = paste0("list_proportion_basic_data.csv")
write.csv(data.frame(i,x), file = fn, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

You can download the data as a CSV file (for importing into a spreadsheet or R): 
[`r fn`](`r fn`)

Answerlist
--------
* What proportion of the measurements are less than `r x1`? In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}<`r x1`]$.
* What proportion of the measurements are less than or equal to `r x2`? In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\le`r x2`]$.
* What proportion of the measurements are greater than `r x3`? In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}>`r x3`]$.
* What proportion of the measurements are greater than or equal to `r x4`? In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\ge`r x4`]$.
* If the proportion of measurements less than $x_{\text{c}}$ is `r p5`, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}<x_{\text{c}}] = `r p5`$.
* If the proportion of measurements less than or equal to $x_{\text{c}}$ is `r p6`, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\le x_{\text{c}}] = `r p6`$.
* If the proportion of measurements greater than $x_{\text{c}}$ is `r p7`, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}>x_{\text{c}}] = `r p7`$.
* If the proportion of measurements greater than or equal to $x_{\text{c}}$ is `r p8`, and $x_{\text{c}}$ is a measurement from sample $\mathbf{x}$, then what is $x_{\text{c}}$? In other words, determine a measurement $x_{\text{c}}$ from sequence $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\ge x_{\text{c}}] = `r p8`$.


Solution
========

[video](https://vimeo.com/531899914){target="_blank"}

First, it helps to sort the data.
$$`r sort(x)`$$

You could use R to sort the data:

```{r echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
str1 = paste('sort(c(',paste(x,collapse=","),'))',collapse="")
str2 = gsub(" ", "", str1, fixed = TRUE)
cat(str2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sort(x)
```

You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use ``Sort`` function.

* (ANS=`r p1`) The proportion of measurements less than `r x1` is `r p1`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}<`r x1`]=`r p1`$$
* (ANS=`r p2`) The proportion of measurements less than or equal to `r x2` is `r p2`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\le `r x2`]=`r p2`$$
* (ANS=`r p3`) The proportion of measurements greater than `r x3` is `r p3`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}> `r x3`]=`r p3`$$
* (ANS=`r p4`) The proportion of measurements greater than or equal to `r x4` is `r p4`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\ge `r x4`]=`r p4`$$
* (ANS=`r x5`) The proportion of measurements less than `r x5` is `r p5`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}<`r x5`]=`r p5`$$
* (ANS=`r x6`) The proportion of measurements less than or equal to `r x6` is `r p6`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\le `r x6`]=`r p6`$$
* (ANS=`r x7`) The proportion of measurements greater than `r x7` is `r p7`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}> `r x7`]=`r p7`$$
* (ANS=`r x8`) The proportion of measurements greater than or equal to `r x8` is `r p8`. $$\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}\ge `r x8`]=`r p8`$$
