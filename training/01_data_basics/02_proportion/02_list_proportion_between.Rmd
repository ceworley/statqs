Question
========

The lengths (in centimeters) of 10 lizards were recorded.

$$\mathbf{x} = `r x` $$

```{r echo=F}
fn = paste0("lizard_data.csv")
write.csv(data.frame(i,x), file = fn, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

You can download the data as a CSV file (for importing into a spreadsheet or R): 
[`r fn`](`r fn`)



Answerlist
--------
* What proportion of the measurements are inside `r b1[1]` cm to `r b1[2]` cm? In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}>`r b1[1]`\texttt{ AND } \mathbf{x}<`r b1[2]`]$. In other words, determine $\text{prop}[`r b1[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b1[2]`]$.
* What proportion of the measurements are outside `r b2[1]` cm to `r b2[2]` cm? In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\mathbf{x}<`r b2[1]`\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}>`r b2[2]`]$. In other words, determine $\text{prop}[\texttt{NOT}(`r b2[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b2[2]`)]$.
* What proportion of the measurements are closer than `r d3` cm from `r c3` cm? In other words, determine $\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c3`\big|<`r d3`\right]$.
* What proportion of the measurements are farther than `r d4` cm from `r c4` cm? In other words, determine $\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c4`\big|>`r d4`\right]$.
* Determine `r wrdint5` radius $r$ of an interval with center `r c5` cm such that $\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c5`\big|<r\right] ~=~ `r p5`$.
* Determine `r wrdint6` radius $r$ of an interval with center `r c6` cm such that $\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c6`\big|>r\right] ~=~ `r p6`$.


Solution
========

[video](https://vimeo.com/531901348){target="_blank"}

First, it helps to sort the data.
$$\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = `r sort(x)`$$

You could use R to sort the data:

```{r echo=FALSE,comment=NA}
str1 = paste('sort(c(',paste(x,collapse=","),'))',collapse="")
str2 = gsub(" ", "", str1, fixed = TRUE)
cat(str2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sort(x)
```

You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use ``Sort`` function.


Answerlist
--------
* (ANS=`r p1`) The proportion of measurements between `r b1[1]` and `r b1[2]` is `r p1`.
$$\text{prop}[`r b1[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b1[2]`]=`r p1`$$
* (ANS=`r p2`) The proportion of measurements outside `r b2[1]` and `r b2[2]` is `r p2`.
$$\text{prop}[\texttt{NOT}(`r b2[1]`<\mathbf{x}<`r b2[2]`)]=`r p2`$$
* (ANS=`r p3`) The proportion of measurements closer than `r d3` cm from `r c3` cm is `r p3`.
$$\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c3`\big|<`r d3`\right] = `r p3`$$
* (ANS=`r p4`) The proportion of measurements farther than `r d4` cm from `r c4` cm is `r p4`. 
$$\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c4`\big|>`r d4`\right] = `r p4`$$
* (ANS=`r d5`) You can guess and check until you find `r wrdint5` that satisfies the equation. It turns out that $r = `r d5`$ satisfies the equation, because $$\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c5`\big|<`r d5`\right] ~=~ `r p5`$$
* (ANS=`r d6`) You can guess and check until you find `r wrdint6` that satisfies the equation. It turns out that $r = `r d6`$ satisfies the equation, because $$\text{prop}\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-`r c6`\big|>`r d6`\right] ~=~ `r p6`$$
