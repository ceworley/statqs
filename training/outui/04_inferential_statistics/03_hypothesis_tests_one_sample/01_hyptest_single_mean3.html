<p>A scientist is investigating whether a chemical may effect the growth of an organism. Under the control conditions (no chemical), the organism grows to a mean mass of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0 = 46.4\)</span> grams with a standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_0 =12.3\)</span> grams. These values are known precisely because the organism has been grown under control conditions many many times.</p>
<p>The scientist has only grown the organism under experimental conditions (with chemical) <span class="math inline">\(n=35\)</span> times. In that sample, the masses have a mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=50.68\)</span>.</p>
<p>The scientist wonders if this sample mean is significantly different from <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span>. To investigate this, the scientist will determine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value" target="blank"><span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value</a>. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value represents the probability of getting a sample mean as far (or farther) from <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> due to chance alone. <span class="math display">\[p\text{-value} ~=~ P\left(\big|Z\big| &gt; \frac{\big|\bar{x}-\mu_0\big|}{\sigma_0/\sqrt{n}} \right) \]</span></p>
<p>It is common to compare the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value to 0.05.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(p\text{-value} &lt; 0.05\)</span> then “significant”</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(p\text{-value} \ge 0.05\)</span> then “not significant”</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><div id='Q' style='background: #AAAAFF'> Determine the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value. </div></li>
<li>Is the difference significant? <div id='Q' style='background: #AAAAFF'> The difference is significant; the chemical seems to alter the growth of the organism. / The difference is not significant; we don’t know whether the chemical alters the growth of the organism. </div></li>
