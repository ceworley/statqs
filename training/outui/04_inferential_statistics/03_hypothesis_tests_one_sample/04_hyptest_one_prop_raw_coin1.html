<p>Connie suspects a coin may be unfair when spun on its edge on a table. She decides to record some spins, using “0” for tails and “1” for heads. After those spins, she will run a one-proportion hypothesis test using a significance level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>.</p>
<p>The data is shown below, and can be <a href="data:text/csv;base64,IngiCjAKMAoxCjAKMAowCjEKMAoxCjAKMAowCjAKMQowCjEKMAowCjAKMQoxCjAKMAoxCjAKMQowCjEKMQowCjEKMAoxCjAKMAowCjAKMQoxCg==" download="one_prop_test.csv" target="blank">downloaded as a csv</a>.</p>
<pre><code>0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1</code></pre>
<p>The null hypothesis states the coin is fair and any deviation between the sample proportion and 0.5 is merely due to chance and natural variation. Thus, the null population proportion is <span class="math inline">\(p_0=0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>The alternative hypothesis states the coin is unfair, so the deviation between the sample proportion and 0.5 is at least partly due to the unfairness of the coin.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value will indicate the probability that a fair coin produces a sample mean as extreme (or more extreme) in its deviation from 0.5. An approximate formula, using a normal approximation of the proportion sampling and not using a continuity correction, is given:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p\text{-value} \approx P\left(|Z| &gt; \frac{|\hat{p}-p_0|}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} \right) \]</span> If you want to make a continuity correction, your <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is more accurate (and larger, more conservative). <span class="math display">\[p\text{-value} \approx P\left(|Z| &gt; \frac{(|\hat{p}-p_0|\cdot n-0.5)/n}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} \right) \]</span></p>
<p>And, if you want to be exactly correct, you need a computer (or a lot of time) to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution" target="blank">binomial distribution</a> formulas.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p\text{-value} = P\left(\left|B(n,p_0)-p_0n\right|\ge \left|n_\text{s}-p_0n\right|\right) \]</span></p>
<p>For this problem, you can use any of those three strategies.</p>
<p><div id='Q' style='background: #AAAAFF'> Determine the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value. </div></p>
<p>Connie compares the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value to the significance level, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>. If the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value is less than 0.05, Connie concludes the coin is unfair. Otherwise, Connie will conclude the coin MIGHT be fair but future measurements may still show the coin is unfair.</p>
<p>Does Connie conclude the coin is unfair?</p>
<p><div id='Q' style='background: #AAAAFF'> Yes, the sample proportion is significantly far from 0.5, so Connie thinks the coin is unfair. / No, the sample proportion is NOT significantly far from 0.5, so Connie retains the belief that the coin MIGHT be fair. </div></p>
