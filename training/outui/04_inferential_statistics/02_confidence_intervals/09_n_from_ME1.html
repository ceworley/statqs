<small><i>04_inferential_statistics/02_confidence_intervals/09_n_from_ME_v1</i></small>
<p>We can approximate a 95% confidence interval (where the 95% refers to the confidence level: how frequently these intervals straddle the population mean) by using <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\pm \frac{2 s}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\text{lower boundary} = \bar{x}-\frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{upper boundary} = \bar{x}+\frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the sample standard deviation, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. The 2 comes from the fact that 95% of normal measurements land within 2 standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<p>The quantity that we subtract from or add to the sample mean is called <strong>the margin of error</strong>. <span class="math display">\[\text{margin of error} = \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span></p>
<p>When using a confidence level of 0.95, knowing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> will be approximately 0.62, and wanting the margin of error to be approximately 0.0068, how large does the sample size need to be?</p>
<p>You can round your answer to two significant digits.</p>
