<small><i>04_inferential_statistics/02_confidence_intervals/10_n_from_ME_prop_v5</i></small>
<p>We can approximate a 95% confidence interval of a <strong>proportion</strong> (where the 95% refers to how frequently these intervals straddle the population proportion) by using <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} \pm \frac{2 \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\text{lower boundary} = \hat{p} - \frac{2 \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{upper boundary} = \hat{p} + \frac{2 \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is the sample proportion and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size. The 2 comes from the fact that 95% of normal measurements land within 2 standard deviations from the mean.</p>
<p>The quantity that we subtract from or add to the sample proportion is called <strong>the margin of error</strong>. <span class="math display">\[\text{margin of error} = \frac{2 \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span></p>
<p>If we know <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> will be approximately 0.97, and we want the margin of error to be approximately 0.0011, then how large does the sample size need to be?</p>
<p>You can round your answer to two significant digits.</p>
