<p>First, it helps to sort the data. <span class="math display">\[\text{sort}(\mathbf{x}) = 51, 52, 52, 52, 53, 53, 53, 53, 54, 55\]</span></p>
<h3 id="r">R</h3>
<p>You could use R to sort the data:</p>
<pre><code>sort(c(55,53,51,53,53,54,52,53,52,52))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] 51 52 52 52 53 53 53 53 54 55</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/531555871" target="_blank">Video of a similar problem solved with R</a></p>
<h3 id="spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</h3>
<p>You could also use a spreadsheet. Import the table into a spreadsheet. Then, highlight the column of measurements and use <code>Sort</code> function.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=1) There are 1 measurements between 54.5 and 57.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[54.5&lt;\mathbf{x}&lt;57.5]=1\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=10) There are 10 measurements outside 55.5 and 56.5. <span class="math display">\[\#[\mathbf{x}&lt;55.5\texttt{ OR } \mathbf{x}&gt;56.5]=10\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=7) There are 7 measurements closer than 1 units from 52.5. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are between 51.5 and 53.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 1 from 52.5 and adding 1 to 52.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-52.5\big|&lt;1\right]=7\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=4) There are 4 measurements farther than 1.5 units from 54. It might help to rephrase the problem as finding how many measurements are outside 52.5 and 55.5. These boundaries are found by subtracting 1.5 from 54 and adding 1.5 to 54. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-54\big|&gt;1.5\right]=4\]</span> </div>
</li>
<li>
<div id='A' style='background: #FFAAAA'> (ANS=3) You can guess and check until you find an integer that satisfies the equation. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(r = 3\)</span> satisfies the equation, because <span class="math inline">\(\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-56.5\big|&lt;3\right] ~=~ 2\)</span>. Notice the boundaries are 53.5 and 59.5, which are found by adding/subtracting 3 to/from 56.5. <span class="math display">\[\#\left[\big|\mathbf{x}-56.5\big|&lt;3\right] ~=~ 2\]</span> </div>
