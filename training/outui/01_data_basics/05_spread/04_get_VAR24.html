<p>A sample was gathered.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{x} = 22.14, 20.04, 20.37, 25.23, 21.98, 21.13, 20.82, 20.13 \]</span></p>
<p>You can download the data as a <a href="data:text/csv;base64,aSx4CjEsMjIuMTQKMiwyMC4wNAozLDIwLjM3CjQsMjUuMjMKNSwyMS45OAo2LDIxLjEzCjcsMjAuODIKOCwyMC4xMwo=" download="get_VAR.csv">CSV file</a>.</p>
<p>Determine the unbiased sample <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Sample_variance" target="blank">variance</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel&#39;s_correction#Formula" target="blank">with Bessel correction</a>). You can round your answer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers)#10%E2%88%922" target="blank">hundredths place</a>.</p>
<p>You probably wonder why you would make the Bessel correction. The reason is important. We will see that the main goal of statistics is to infer the underlying probability distribution of a collection of empirical observations. In other words, we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_machine" target="blank">lottery machine</a> filled with many balls (population), but we only see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_random_sample" target="blank">small sample</a> of those balls, and our goal is to guess what the population looks like based on a small sample (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference" target="blank">statistical inference</a>).</p>
<p>It turns out that when guessing the populationâ€™s variance from a small sample, your guess is better after making the Bessel correction.</p>
