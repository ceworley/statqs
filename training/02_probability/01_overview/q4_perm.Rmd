`r q`

Solution

[video](https://vimeo.com/531916131){target="_blank"}

This scenario describes a permutations problem (order matters). We are considering the nonrepeating sequences of size `r x` from a set of size `r n`.

$$\begin{aligned}
{_nP_r} &= \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\\\
n &= `r n` \\\\
r &= `r x` \\\\
{_{`r n`}P_{`r x`}} &= \frac{`r n`!}{(`r n`-`r x`)! } \\\\
&= \frac{`r n`!}{`r n-x`!} \\\\
&= `r sss` \\\\
&= `r ans`
\end{aligned}$$
