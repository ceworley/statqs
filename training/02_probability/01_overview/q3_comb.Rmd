Question

`r q`

Solution

[video](https://vimeo.com/531916131){target="_blank"}

This scenario describes a combinations problem (order does not matter). We are considering the subsets of size `r x` from a set of size `r n`.

$$\begin{aligned}
{_nC_r} &= \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!} \\\\
n &= `r n` \\\\
r &= `r x` \\\\
{_{`r n`}C_{`r x`}} &= \frac{`r n`!}{(`r n`-`r x`)!\cdot `r x`! } \\\\
&= \frac{`r n`!}{`r n-x`! \cdot `r x`!} \\\\
&= \frac{`r sss`}{`r ss2`} \\\\
&= `r ans`
\end{aligned}$$
