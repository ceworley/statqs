Question
========
In some situation, each trial has `r p` probability of success. There will be `r n` trials. (Thus the number of successes will follow a [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution){target="blank"}.)

Answerlist
--------
* What is the probability of getting exactly `r x1` successes? In other words, determine $\mathbb{P}[X = `r x1`]$.
* What is the probability of getting exactly `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\mathbb{P}[X = `r x2`]$.
* What is the probability of getting more than `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\mathbb{P}[X > `r x2`]$.
* What is the probability of getting at least `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\mathbb{P}[X \ge `r x2`]$.
* What is the probability of getting less than `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\mathbb{P}[X < `r x2`]$.
* What is the probability of getting at most `r x2` successes? In other words, determine $\mathbb{P}[X \le `r x2`]$.
* Determine the mean number of successes.
* Determine the standard deviation of successes.

This is a binomial distribution, so use the appropriate formulas. $$\mathbb{P}[X=x] ~=~ _n\text{C}_x \cdot p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$ where $p$ is the probability of success on each trial, $x$ is a specific number of successes, $n$ is the number of trials, and $C$ is the combinations operator (so that ${_n}C_x = \frac{n!}{(n-x)! \, x!}$). Some people prefer to also use $q$ as the probability of failure, such that $q=1-p$.
$$\mathbb{P}[X=x] ~=~ _n\text{C}_x \cdot p^xq^{n-x}$$

You will also need to add [mutually exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity){target="blank"} probabilities (when multiple $x$-values satisfy the probability's condition). It is also helpful to be aware of the [complement rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_event#Complement_rule){target="blank"}.

Answerlist
--------
* $\text{Pr}(X=`r x1`) ~=~ \left({_{`r n`}}C_{`r x1`}\right)\left(`r p`^{`r x1`}\right) \left(`r 1-p`^{`r n-x1`}\right) ~=~ `r dbinom(x1,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X=`r x2`) ~=~ \left({_{`r n`}}C_{`r x2`}\right)\left(`r p`^{`r x2`}\right)\left(`r 1-p`^{`r n-x2`}\right) ~=~ `r dbinom(x2,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X > `r x2`) ~=~ `r 1-pbinom(x2,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X \ge `r x2`) ~=~ `r 1-pbinom(x2-1,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X < `r x2`) ~=~ `r pbinom(x2-1,n,p)`$
* $\text{Pr}(X \le `r x2`) ~=~ `r pbinom(x2,n,p)`$
* Because this is a binomial distribution, $\mu = np$, so $\mu = `r n*p`$
* Because this is a binomial distribution, $\sigma = \sqrt{npq}$, so $\sigma = `r sqrt(n*p*(1-p))`$
