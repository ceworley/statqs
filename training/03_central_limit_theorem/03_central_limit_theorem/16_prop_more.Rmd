Question
========

In some game, each trial has a $p = `r p`$ probability of success. A player will attempt `r n` trials. What is the probability that the proportion of successes is more than `r phat`?

(Even though single trials are **not** normally distributed [they follow a [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution){target="_blank"}], the random proportion will be normally distributed.
See [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem){target="_blank"}.
Also, I have already made the [continuity correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction){target="_blank"}. )


Solution
========

[video](https://vimeo.com/531943173){target="_blank"}

We determine the mean and standard deviation of the proportion sampling distribution.
$$\mu ~=~ p ~=~ `r mu`$$
$$\sigma ~=~ \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} ~=~ \sqrt{\frac{(`r p`)(`r 1-p`)}{n}} ~=~ `r siga` $$

We determine a $z$-score. (The common notation is $\hat{p}$ for a specific proportion.)
$$\begin{aligned}
z &= \frac{\hat{p} - \mu}{\sigma} \\\\
&= \frac{`r phat`-`r mu`}{`r siga`} \\\\
&= `r z`
\end{aligned}$$

Then, find the standard normal probability.

$$P(Z > `r z`) ~=~ `r ra` $$

Of course, you could have rounded $z$, so the following will also get credit.
$$P(Z > `r zlo`) ~=~ `r ralo` $$
$$P(Z > `r zhi`) ~=~ `r rahi` $$
