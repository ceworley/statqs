Question
========

A scientist has grown `r n` specimens under novel conditions and found that `r p*100`% of them survived (in other words $\hat{p}=`r p`$). The scientist hopes to construct a 95% [**confidence interval**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval){target="blank"} of the survival rate.

The scientist will later consult a statistician for a more precise method, but for now she will use a quick method to estimate the 95% confidence interval:
$$\hat{p}\pm 2\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} $$

You can round answers to the nearest thousandth.

Answerlist
--------
* Determine the lower boundary of the confidence interval by using $\hat{p}- 2\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$.
* Determine the upper boundary of the confidence interval by using $\hat{p}+ 2\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$.


Solution
========

Plug the numbers into the expressions.

Answerlist
--------
* Lower bound = $~`r p`-2\sqrt{\frac{(`r p`)(1-`r p`)}{`r n`}} ~=~ `r LB`$
* Upper bound = $~`r p`+2\sqrt{\frac{(`r p`)(1-`r p`)}{`r n`}} ~=~ `r UB`$
