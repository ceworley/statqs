Question
========

A scientist is investigating whether a chemical may effect the survival rate of an organism. Under the control conditions (no chemical), the organism has a survival rate of $p_0=`r p0`$. This value is known precisely because the organism has been grown under control conditions many many times.

The scientist has only grown the organism under experimental conditions (with chemical) $n=`r n`$ times. In that sample, the survival rate is $\hat{p} = `r phat`$.

The scientist wonders if this survival rate is significantly different from $p_0$. To investigate this, the scientist will determine the $p$-value. The $p$-value represents the probability of getting a sample proportion as far (or farther) from $p_0$ due to chance alone.
$$p\text{-value} ~=~ P\left(\big|Z\big| > \frac{\big|\hat{p}-p_0\big|}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \right) $$

It is common to compare the $p$-value to 0.05.

* If $p\text{-value} < 0.05$ then "significant"
* If $p\text{-value} \ge 0.05$ then "not significant"


Answerlist
--------
* Determine the $p$-value.
* The difference is significant. The chemical seems to alter the growth of the organism.
* The difference is not significant. We don't know whether the chemical alters the growth of the organism.


Solution
========

We need to calculate the $p$-value.
$$\begin{aligned}
p\text{-value} &= P\left(\big|Z\big| > \frac{\big|\hat{p}-p_0\big|}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \right) \\\\
&= P\left(\big|Z\big| > \frac{\big|`r phat`-`r p0`\big|}{\sqrt{\frac{(`r p0`)(`r 1-p0`)}{`r n`}}} \right) \\\\
&= P\left(\big|Z\big| > `r abs(z)` \right) \\\\
&= `r pval`
\end{aligned}$$

Of course you could have rounded the $z$ score. Either of the following will also get credit.

$$p\text{-value} ~=~ \left(\big|Z\big| > `r zlo` \right) ~=~ `r pvallo`$$
$$p\text{-value} ~=~ \left(\big|Z\big| > `r zhi` \right) ~=~ `r pvalhi`$$

Answerlist
--------
* `r pval`
* `r pval<0.05`
* `r pval>=0.05`
